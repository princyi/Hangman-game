**Code Explanation:**

This Python code implements a basic Hangman game.

**Import Statements:**

 `import random`: This imports the `random` module which is used to randomly select a word from the word list.
 `from logo_stages import hangman_stages, logo`: This imports the `hangman_stages` and `logo` variables from the `logo_stages` module. `hangman_stages` likely contains a list of strings representing different stages of the hangman drawing, and `logo` is probably the game's title or introduction.
 `# from hangman_words import word_list`: This line is commented out, but it suggests that there's a potential module named `hangman_words` containing a word list.
 `from replit import clear`: This imports the `clear` function from the `replit` module, which is used to clear the console screen.

**Game Initialization:**

 `print(logo)`: Displays the game's logo or title.
 `word_list = ["APPMILLERS", "UDEMY"]`: Defines a list of words to choose from for the game.
 `secret_word = random.choice(word_list)`: Randomly selects a word from the `word_list` and assigns it to `secret_word`.
 `word_length = len(secret_word)`: Calculates the length of the secret word and stores it in `word_length`.
 `guessed_letters = []`: Initializes an empty list to store letters guessed by the player.
 `blanks = []`: Initializes an empty list to represent the word with underscores.
 `lives = 6`: Sets the initial number of lives for the player.
 `for _ in range(word_length):`: Creates a list of underscores (`_`) with the same length as the secret word.

**Game Loop:**

 `end_game = False`: Initializes a flag to control the game loop.
 `while not end_game:`: Starts the game loop that continues until `end_game` is True.
   `guess = input("Guess a letter: ").upper()`: Prompts the player to guess a letter and converts it to uppercase.
  * `clear()`: Clears the console screen.
   `if guess in guessed_letters:`: Checks if the guessed letter has already been guessed. If yes, prints a message and continues to the next iteration.
   `else:`: If the letter hasn't been guessed before, adds it to the `guessed_letters` list.
     `for position in range(word_length):`: Iterates through each letter in the secret word.
       `letter = secret_word[position]`: Gets the current letter from the secret word.
       `if guess == letter:`: If the guessed letter matches the current letter, replaces the corresponding underscore in `blanks` with the letter.
`if guess not in secret_word:`: If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, decreases the number of lives by 1.
       `if lives == 0:`: If the player runs out of lives, sets `end_game` to True and prints a "You Lose" message.
`print(" ".join(blanks))`: Prints the current state of the word with guessed letters.
     `# TODO 2`: This comment indicates a potential place to add code, possibly to display the hangman figure based on the number of lives.
     `print(hangman_stages[lives])`: Prints the current hangman stage based on the number of lives.
     `if "_" not in blanks:`: Checks if all letters have been guessed. If yes, sets `end_game` to True and prints a "You win" message.
     `# TODO 1`: This comment indicates another potential place to add code, possibly related to game over actions.
`if end_game:`: If the game has ended (win or lose), asks the player if they want to play again.
     If the player enters "Y", resets the game variables and starts a new game.
     If the player enters anything else, prints 

**Additional Notes:**

* The code uses `clear()` from the `replit` module, which might not work in other environments. 
* The `hangman_stages` module and its contents are not provided, so the exact behavior of the hangman drawing is unknown.
* The code could be improved by adding error handling for invalid input (e.g., guessing more than one letter at a time).
* There are potential places for additional features, as indicated by the `TODO` comments.
